# CPSC-478-Final-Project

Generated a 10-second ray tracing video utilizing the CMU motion capture dataset. Video idea inspired by my GOAT LeBron James and the show *Slam Dunk*.

**Implemented Features:**
- Anti-aliasing
- Soft shadows
- Texture mapping
- Basic ray tracing (reflection and refraction)
